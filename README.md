# Kubernetes (K8S) DevOps Practice

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing Kubernetes by deploying various DevOps tools in a local environment using **Minikube**. The goal is to simulate a production-like CI/CD pipeline and containerized infrastructure. It includes setups for tools like **Jenkins** for automated builds, **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment, and **Harbor** for managing Docker images as a container registry.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Kubernetes (K8S)**: The orchestration platform used to manage containers.
- **Minikube**: A lightweight Kubernetes implementation for local testing.
- **Jenkins**: For automating builds and CI tasks.
- **ArgoCD**: For GitOps-based continuous delivery.
- **Harbor**: An open-source container registry for managing and scanning Docker images.

## Features
- Setting up **DevOps tools** (Jenkins, ArgoCD) on a Minikube cluster.
- Integrating **Harbor** as a Docker image registry.
- Practicing continuous integration and deployment workflows.
- Exploring Kubernetes resource management and deployment strategies.

## Prerequisites
- **Minikube** installed and configured on your local machine.
- **kubectl** CLI configured to manage the Minikube cluster.
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes and containerization.
